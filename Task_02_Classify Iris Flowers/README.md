# Iris Flower Classification

Author: Hassan Anwar


## Project Overview

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements using Machine Learning. It uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to achieve this classification task. The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `iris.data`: The dataset file containing sepal and petal measurements for Iris flowers.
- `Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- Pandas: For data loading and manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn: For machine learning, including SVM classifier.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd iris-flower-classification
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb` to load the dataset, visualize the data, train the SVM classifier, and evaluate its performance.

4. Follow the code comments in the notebook for detailed instructions on each step.

## Results

The SVM classifier achieves an accuracy of 100% on the test data, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying Iris flowers into their respective species.
